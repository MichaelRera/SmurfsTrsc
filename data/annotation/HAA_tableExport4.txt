RPTOR,"P150 Target Of Rapamycin (TOR)-Scaffold Protein Containing WD-Repeats","regulatory-associated protein of mTOR","It involved in the control of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activity which regulates cell growth and survival, and autophagy in response to nutrient and hormonal signals; functions as a scaffold for recruiting mTORC1 substrates. mTORC1 is activated in response to growth factors or amino acids. Growth factor-stimulated mTORC1 activation involves a AKT1-mediated phosphorylation of TSC1-TSC2, which leads to the activation of the RHEB GTPase that potently activates the protein kinase activity of mTORC1.","deregulated nutrient sensing","Homo sapiens","mTOR interacts with raptor to form a nutrient-sensitive complex that signals to the growth machinery",10.1016/s0092-8674(02)00808-5,hsa04211,"Longevity regulating pathway",57521
S100B,"S100; NEF","S100 calcium binding protein B","It weakly binds calcium but binds zinc very tightly-distinct binding sites with different affinities exist for both ions on each monomer. Physiological concentrations of potassium ion antagonize the binding of both divalent cations, especially affecting high-affinity calcium-binding sites.",others,"Homo sapiens","Zinc Binding to S100B Affords Regulation of Trace Metal Homeostasis and Excitotoxicity in the Brain",10.3389/fnmol.2017.00456,unknown,Unknown,6285
