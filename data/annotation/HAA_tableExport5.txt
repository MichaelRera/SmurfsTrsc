ZAP70,SRK,"Zeta Chain Of T Cell Receptor Associated Protein Kinase 70","Tyrosine kinase that plays an essential role in regulation of the adaptive immune response. Regulates motility, adhesion and cytokine expression of mature T-cells, as well as thymocyte development. Contributes also to the development and activation of primary B-lymphocytes. When antigen presenting cells (APC) activate T-cell receptor (TCR), a serie of phosphorylations lead to the recruitment of ZAP70 to the doubly phosphorylated TCR component CD247/CD3Z through ITAM motif at the plasma membrane. This recruitment serves to localization to the stimulated TCR and to relieve its autoinhibited conformation. Release of ZAP70 active conformation is further stabilized by phosphorylation mediated by LCK.","NF-κB related gene","Homo sapiens","Otud7b facilitates T cell activation and inflammatory responses by regulating Zap70 ubiquitination",10.1084/jem.20151426,hsa04064,"NF-kappa B signaling pathway",7535
